# aria-form-validation
Uses aria attributes to style and validate form inputs

Uses aria-invalid to assign visual error indicators with CSS attribute selectors when validation of field fails.

Summary of errors is placed at the top in an aria-live enabled div. 

Inline error indicators are dynamically placed inside individual error form inputs.

Form validation on submission is keyed off of aria-required attributes. 

Required field styling is dynamically added from aria-required attributes.
